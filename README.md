## Â¡Hola! Â¿QuÃ© Tal?
Hello, My name is Chifuyu Arabelio, and I am a software developer with over 15 years of experience. I`m also an avid mountain climber, which I find both challenging and rewarding. I have the logest experience with Objective-C(MRC/ARC), having been involved in app development since developers could first release apps on the iPhone.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as
a full-stack engineer on a project that involves developing both mobile and web applications aimed at streamlining business processes.

My role inclues handling server side logic using Python, PHP, and SQL, as well as client side development with a range of languages including Objective-C, Dart, C#, Android Java, and Swift.

This diverse technology stack allows us to create robust, scalable applications tailored to our clients needs.

Thank you for readingðŸŒ·
