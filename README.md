## About me
Â¡Hola! Â¿QuÃ© Tal? My name is Chifuyu Ara BelÃ­o, and I am a software developer with over 15 years of experience. I'm also an avid mountain climber, which I find both challenging and rewarding. I started programming when I took a programming course in college, where I learned the C and Java languages. In 2004, I created a Windows Desktop Application using VC++ in Visual Studio .NET 2003 Academic Edition on my own. I have the longest experience with Objective-C, having been involved in app development since developers could first release apps on the iPhone.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as
a full-stack engineer on a project that involves developing both mobile and web applications aimed at streamlining business processes.

My role includes handling server-side logic using Python, PHP, and SQL, as well as client-side development with a range of languages including Objective-C, Flutter, C#, Java, and Swift.

This diverse technology stack allows us to create robust, scalable applications tailored to our clients' needs.

Thank you for readingðŸŒ·
